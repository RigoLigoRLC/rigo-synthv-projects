Baby, when I see you I feel like I'm flying high,
Feel like I'm flying high, you make me feel alive.
And every smile you show me can brighten up the night,
It brightens up the night, like a candle to my life, and I

feel your touch even when you aren't by my side,
You aren't by my side but it still takes me for a ride.
There is nothing I won't do to make you feel alright._
Cos you make me feel alright, and I've loved you dear for all my life.

And when you kiss me,
It's like fantasy.
I know we both see
you were made for me.

When the moment's right,
the stars shine so bright.
Tonight is the night.
I'll show you the
feelings locked inside

Let's bring this city to life.
I've got nothing to lose, the time is right.
I've been waiting for this moment my entire life, ooh-woh-oh-oh-oh,
I'll tell you how I feel under the moonlight.

I know I gotta do this right.
Baby, I want you to be mine.

It's been a long time coming,
But I just want you to know, (All these feelings I have to show)
Since the day I met you,
I would never let you go, I won't ever let this moment go. (This love is far from personal)

I remember the first time you kissed me on the lips,
You kissed me on the lips, my brain practically flipped.
Ever since then, every day spent with you has been bliss,
Spent with you has been bliss, and it's all led ri-ight up to this.

Baby, tell me please you feel the same way now,
Do you feel the same way now, beyond a shadow of a doubt?
Do you want this feeling to last 'till the end of time?
Until the end of time, will you promise me that you'll be mine?

Oh yeah, I confess.
Baby, please say yes.
Every second is bliss.
I want to stay just like this, oh baby,

I won't waste this chance.
This ain't my last dance.
Baby, please just say yes.
Baby, baby, let's stay just like this.
